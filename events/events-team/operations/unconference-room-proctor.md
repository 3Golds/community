# Contributor Summit Unconference Sessions Moderator Instructions

Thanks for volunteering to moderate one of our unconference sessions! Your contribution will make sure everyone can share knowledge and collaborate.

To be a successful moderator, you’ll complete the following tasks:

* Arrive at least 5 minutes before the unconference session is scheduled to start
* Make sure the room has appropriate supplies e.g. pens, paper, etc
* Find a volunteer notekeeper or two and have them take notes in the shared Google Drive folder: https://k8s.dev/summit/notes. You will also find this link in the #contributor-summit Slack channel. The Google Drive folder contains the notes template needed
* Each unconference block should have one (1) notes document, named for the room name and session (Unconference) your unconference block is happening in. If a notes document already exists for your room, continue note-taking there. Share this document in the #contributor-summit Slack channel for attendees to find and access
* When it comes to crowd participation, don't let one person monopolize the conversation – pay attention to the discussion and politely encourage and highlight other people who have may have things to add
* “Has everyone who wants to say something had a chance to do so?" – this is a great phrase to use to encourage more people to share their thoughts!
* You’ll need to conduct time checks at the 10 minute and 5 minute mark, ensuring you end 3 minutes before the start of the next session block – visual cues for speakers are best. All sessions must end on time so that contributors can rely on our shared schedule and participate accordingly


Thank you again for your help and support. We hope you enjoy taking part in the Contributor Summit and the unconference sessions!
