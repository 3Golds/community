# Contributor Summit SIG Meeting Moderator Instructions

Thanks for volunteering to moderate a general session in the main presentation room! 
Your contribution will make sure everyone can share knowledge and collaborate.
SIGs can reserve a room for a SIG meeting and discussion at the Contributor Summit.

To be a successful moderator, you’ll complete the following tasks:

* Arrive at least 5 minutes before the session is scheduled to start
* Ask the SIG if they would requested any AV and verify AV is working like microphone(s) or projector. Help troubleshoot any problems with AV, facilities, or event staff.
* Timekeeping is valuable to make sure the day's schedule goes as planned. Make sure the session both begins and ends on time. Provide a time check to the session leader at 5/2/1 minute warnings (before the session is scheduled to end). At the latest, ensure you end 3 minutes before the start of the next session block.
* Make sure the room has appropriate supplies e.g. pens, paper, etc
* As a SIG meeting may be an official SIG meeting, SIGs should facilitate note taking if applicable
* When it comes to crowd participation, don't let one person monopolize the conversation – pay attention to the discussion and politely encourage and highlight other people who have may have things to add
* Keep an eye on the summit slack channels

Thank you once again for your help and support. We hope you enjoy taking part in the Contributor Summit!
