# Contributor Summit SIG Meeting Room Proctor Instructions

Thanks for volunteering to moderate a general session in the main presentation room! 
Your contribution will make sure everyone can share knowledge and collaborate.
SIGs can reserve a room for a SIG meeting and discussion at the Contributor Summit.

To be a successful moderator, youâ€™ll complete the following tasks:

* Arrive at least 5 minutes before the session is scheduled to start
* Find out who is running the SIG meeting, and make sure they're ready and present.  If the SIG lead does not show, help SIG members decide on someone else to lead the meeting.
* Ask the SIG if they would requested any AV and verify AV is working like microphone(s) or projector. Help troubleshoot any problems with AV, facilities, or event staff.
* Timekeeping is valuable to make sure the day's schedule goes as planned. Make sure the session both begins and ends on time. Provide a time check to the session leader at 5/2/1 minute warnings (before the session is scheduled to end). At the latest, ensure you end 3 minutes before the start of the next session block.
* Make sure the room has appropriate supplies e.g. pens, paper, etc
* As a SIG meeting may be an official SIG meeting, SIGs should facilitate note taking if applicable
* Keep an eye on the summit slack channels

Thank you once again for your help and support. We hope you enjoy taking part in the Contributor Summit!
