# Contributor Summit Presentation Sessions Moderator Instructions

Thanks for volunteering to moderate one of the presentation sessions! 
Presentation sessions are 30 minute sessions in which a speaker is making a slide presentation to the contributors.  
Your contribution will make sure everyone can share knowledge and collaborate.

To be a successful moderator, youâ€™ll complete the following tasks:

* Arrive at least 5 minutes before the session is scheduled to start
* Make sure the speaker shows up -- hopefully a few minutes early to setup 
* Verify AV is working: sound, projection, recording (if applicable), check if there is a second microphone for Q&A. Help troubleshoot any problems with AV, facilities, or event staff.
* It's best if you sit in the front row
* Introduce the speaker and session
* Timekeeping is valuable to make sure the day's schedule goes as planned. Make sure the session both begins and ends on time. Provide a time check with a visual cue at 5 minutes before the session is scheduled to end. At the latest, ensure you end 3 minutes before the start of the next session block.
* If there is time for Q&A, facilatate the Q&A.
* Keep an eye on the summit slack channels

Thank you once again for your help and support. We hope you enjoy taking part in the Contributor Summit!
