# Contributor Summit General Sessions in the Main Presentation Room: Moderator Instructions

Thanks for volunteering to moderate a general session in the main presentation room! 
Your contribution will make sure everyone can share knowledge and collaborate.
The general sessions in the main presentation room include things like the introductions, the Steering Q&A, and the Awards. Unlike all other kinds of sessions, they will be staffed by other members of the Summit Staff, including the Summit Leads and Content staff. As such, the room proctors for these are there to supplement these other staff, and may do any of the following as needed:

* Arrive at least 5 minutes before the session is scheduled to start
* Timekeeping is valuable to make sure the day's schedule goes as planned. Make sure the session both begins and ends on time. Ask the presenter/moderator if they would like a time check. If so, provide a time check with a visual cue at 5 minutes before the session is scheduled to end. At the latest, ensure you end 3 minutes before the start of the next session block.
* Usher attendees to seats
* Help run mics to contributors during Q&A sessions
* Troubleshooting AV and running AV issues to AV staff
* Other tasks as needed by other staff
* Keep an eye on the summit slack channels

Thank you once again for your help and support. We hope you enjoy taking part in the Contributor Summit!
