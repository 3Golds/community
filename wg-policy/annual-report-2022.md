# 2022 Annual Report: WG Policy

## Current initiatives

1. What work did the WG do this year that should be highlighted?
   For example, artifacts, reports, white papers produced this year.

   - [Policy Whitepaper]()
   - [PolicyReport CRD]() Adapters, [list here]()
   - [Review of whether to KEP or not to KEP for Policy Report]()
   -

2. What initiatives are you working on that aren't being tracked in KEPs?

   - The main topic of discussion is now whether to KEP the PolicyReport, or just keep it in a sig (e.g. sig-auth)
   - Outside of that there has been a lot of community interest, and workgroup effort spent, on control mapping
     and control-as-code implementation, eg OSCAL, that might be better served moved into its own workgroup or a 
     sandbox project

## Project health

1. What's the current roadmap until completion of the working group?

   - We intend to wrap up the workgroup once the KEP for PolicyReport is created OR sig-auth or another sig accepts it
   - Or if neither occurs
   - There is considerable interest in continuing the governance and assessment and lifecycle of policy and controls,
     however as these necessarily cross boundaries, it seems like something that should either be re-homed to sig-security,
     and/or hosted in a CNCF-level workgroup and/or moved into a relevant sandbox CNCF project, eg. [SLEDGEHammer]().

2. Does the group have contributors from multiple companies/affiliations?

   - Yes, RedHat, IBM, SunStone Secure, Nirmata, Google, ...

3. Are there ways end users/companies can contribute that they currently are not?
   If one of those ways is more full time support, what would they work on and why?
